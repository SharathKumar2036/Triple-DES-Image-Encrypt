# Triple-DES-Image-Encrypt

Abstract: 

In todayâ€™s world almost all digital services like internet communication,
medical and military imaging systems, multimedia system needs a high level
and Protected security. There is a need for security level in order to safely store
and transmit digital images containing critical information. This is because of
the faster growth in multimedia technology, internet and cell phones. Therefore
there is a need for image encryption techniques in order to hide images from
such attacks. In this system we use Triple DES (Data Encryption Standard) in
order to hide image. Such Encryption technique helps to avoid Active and
Passive Attacks.The triple DES algorithm is based on The DES algorithm itself
its uses same method as that of the DES but the difference is that it uses 3 keys
rather than just one. For the encryption process it initially encrypts the data
using just one key and then decrypts the data using another different key and
then finally encrypts the data again using another key. For the decryption
process it is the reverse of the encryption process it initially decrypts the cipher
data using one key, then encrypts the data using another key and then finally
decrypts the data back to its original form using the another different key. This
algorithm uniquely defines the mathematical steps required to transform the
image into a cryptographic cipher and also to transforms the cipher image back
to its original form.
